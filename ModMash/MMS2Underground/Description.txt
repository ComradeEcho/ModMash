Simplified version of original ModMash Splinter Underground + Trains Mod
For the reasons of compatibility and simplifying code base the foolowing changes are being made
Removing all experimantal detection mothods

All top level Surfaces(Planets) must be defined in prototypes.scripts.surfaces.lua 
or 
added via control interface mms2underground.register_surface

resources can be added to surfaces by calling the control interface mms2underground.register_resource

This will not change however it should be possible for third party mods to easily add
